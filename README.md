# TetriPad
This is a project I made for Highway called the Tetripad a custom hackpad built to play Tetris with precision and style! It features 4 switches arranged in a pyramid layout, just like the classic D-pad, making movement super intuitive. I designed it to give me fast, reliable control for games like Tetris, especially when regular keyboards just don't cut it. It also has an OLED screen that responds to my inputs, which makes it feel way more interactive and alive. This is one of my first full firmware + hardware projects, and it’s been a blast combining code, wiring, and gameplay into one neat little build. I’m excited to keep building more projects like this and push what I can do even further!<br/>
